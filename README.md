# Doctor-Appointment-app
 Overview
This project aims to develop a doctor appointment interface using Python for backend logic and Firebase for database and authentication services. The application is designed to facilitate seamless scheduling, managing, and viewing of doctor appointments for both patients and doctors. The primary objective is to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform that simplifies the appointment process.

Features
User Registration and Authentication: Secure user registration and login using Firebase Authentication, supporting various authentication methods (email/password, Google, etc.).
Appointment Management:
Patients: View available doctors and time slots, book appointments, and receive confirmation notifications.
Doctors: Manage their schedules, view upcoming appointments, and update availability.
Database Management: Use Firestore to securely and efficiently store user profiles, appointment details, and doctor schedules.
API Endpoints: Develop RESTful API endpoints using Flask to handle operations such as booking appointments, fetching available slots, updating user profiles, and retrieving appointment histories.
Responsive Frontend: Create a web application using Flask templates or a JavaScript framework like React, or develop a mobile application using frameworks like Kivy to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Technology Stack
Firebase: For backend services, including Firestore for the database and Firebase Authentication for user management.
Python: For server-side logic, managing API requests, and interacting with Firebase.
Frontend:Created using PYQT5.
